# {%flowData.appName%}

This is an **yoshi editor flow** (out of iframe) project.

The main idea of Editor Flow is to provide the best developer experience, the most optimized bundle, and a lot of features to reduce boilerplate on the user's side.

Loading experiments and translations, sending errors to sentry, monitoring client-side and server-side rendering time, sled end-to-end testing, providing relevant bi logger, live reload, and local overrides - everything is being provided from the box and works automatically.

## Setup ðŸ”§

##### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

##### Start the project:

```bash
npm start
```

In case you are starting it the first time - the basic editor flow guide will be opened. It includes steps you need to take to finish the configuration.

If viewer and editor URLs were already configured in `dev/sites.js` - the flow will open chrome with 2 tabs - viewer and editor. Then you can just start to develop the out of iframe widget in a production environment with HMR and local overrides.

## Deployment ðŸš€

Just commit changes you made and push it to github. The [auto-release](https://github.com/wix-private/devcenter/tree/master/serverless/app-service-autorelease) mechanism is configured from the box.

> Be sure your app in dev center has `Wix TPA` checkbox enabled.

## Testing ðŸ¤ž

The app contains e2e and unit tests.

- **e2e** tests are located under the `sled` directory.
- **Unit** tests could be found in the components' source directory.

##### Running tests:

```bash
npm test
```
