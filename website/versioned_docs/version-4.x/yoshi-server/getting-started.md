Welcome to Yoshi Server documentation!

Yoshi Server makes it easier to consume data from the server by adding an abstraction over client server communication, using conventions.

## Why we built Yoshi Server

#### Less boilerplate

With Yoshi Server, there's no need to setup a [node-platform](https://github.com/wix-platform/wix-node-platform) server.

#### Type safety for client-server communication

When using Typescript, client-server communication is fully typed.

#### Better error handling

Yoshi Server handles server errors and displays them on your browser.

#### Built in HMR support

HMR support out of the box, no need to setup anything.

#### Get updates easier

With Yoshi server, it will be easier to ship updates without breaking changes.

## Setup

We recommend creating a new Yoshi Server app using the [`create-yoshi-app`](https://wix.github.io/yoshi/docs/getting-started/create-app). It is available for both Fullstack and Business Manager apps.

```bash
npx create-yoshi-app my-app-name
```

## Manual setup

##### Prerequisits

- A fullstack app (both server and client are together, using the same `package.json` file).
- We currently support only projects using the `app-flow` ("projectType": "app" in your Yoshi configuration). If you do not use it, please migrate first (see https://wix.github.io/yoshi/docs/guides/app-flow for more details)

Install `yoshi-server` and `yoshi-server-client`:

```
npm install yoshi-server yoshi-server-client
```

Update `yoshi.config.js` of `package.json`'s `yoshi` section:

```diff
"yoshi": {
  "projectType": "app",
+  "yoshiServer": true,
...
}
```

Set your server to handle requests

Yoshi Server will handle server requests by convention (see [server functions](consuming-data-from-the-server#server-functions) and [route functions](exposing-route)). All we have to do is bootstrap it from our `index.js` file:

```js
require("yoshi-server/bootstrap");
```

Now you are ready to add your first Yoshi Server function.

## Adding your first Yoshi Server function

> Files with `.api.js` or `.api.ts` extention with named export functions will be treated as [server functions](consuming-data-from-the-server#server-functions).

Add a `greet.api.ts` file to your project (if your project is in Javascript, use `.js` for all examples):

```js
// greet.api.ts
import { method } from "yoshi-server";

export const greeting = method(function(name: string) {
  return {
    greet: `hello ${name}!`,
    name
  };
});
```

Now that we have our first server function (`greeting`), let's consume the data from our client code.

```js
import HttpClient from "yoshi-server-client";
import { greeting } from "./greet.api";

// For Business Manager modules, we map all api requests to '/_api/projectName'
const client = new HttpClient();

client.request({ method: greeting, args: ["John"] }).then(data => {
  console.log(data.greet);
});
```

That's it!

Running `npx yoshi start` shows `hello John` in the console.

#### What just happened here?

- `yoshi-server-client` is triggering xhr calls behind the scenes.
- `yoshi-server` has one endpoint, `_api_` (open devtools to see it). All requests are made as `post` requests, with data about the function that we want to call and the arguments.
- If you are using Typescript, server arguments and response are typed!
- For Business Manager modules, all API requests to `/_api/projectName` are mapped to `/_api_` (Yoshi Server)
